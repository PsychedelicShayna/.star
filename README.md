# .star

A collection of helpful scripts, config files, and other things that drive my day to day terminal experience. Currently 90% of said things are missing, but over time I'll add them here as I go about restructuring things. This is mostly a repo for myself, but if you take inspiration from any of my configs or scripts, or enjoy using them yourself, then yay!
